## Case Study: Redesigning the USU Graduate School Website

### The Challenge

The School of Graduate Studies at Utah State University came to our team with a clear ask:  
Make the site more useful and more inspiring — for both current and prospective graduate students.

The old site felt bland and confusing. It wasn’t doing justice to the graduate experience at USU, and the marketing team wanted to transform it into something they could proudly share at events.

### My Role

I led the project from start to finish —  
conducting user interviews,  
running usability tests,  
creating mockups in Figma, and  
building the final site in Modern Campus (Omni CMS).  
I also managed our student developers and coordinated with the Grad School marketing team to ensure we aligned on goals and branding.

### What We Discovered

Before we touched a line of code, I spoke with nearly 50 current grad students to understand how they used (or didn’t use) the site.

The most surprising finding?  
Almost no current students used the site after they enrolled.

Most pointed to their individual program pages as their go-to resource. That insight completely shifted our direction.

We also ran targeted usability tests with 10 students trying to find key information. We found:
- Acronyms like “GPC” caused confusion
- Navigation was structured around audience types (e.g. “Future Students”, “Faculty”), which didn’t reflect user goals
- The site lacked any visual or emotional appeal to prospective students

### The Shift: Focus on Prospective Students

Armed with this research, we pivoted the site strategy:

- Focused on prospective students as the primary audience  
- Cut or consolidated pages that were redundant or rarely visited  
- Simplified navigation to be task-based, not audience-based  
- Rewrote content to be clearer and more action-oriented  
- Added "Why USU" marketing content: stats, visuals, and emotional appeal

### Before vs. After: Navigation

**Before:**  
Future Students • Student Resources • Faculty Resources • Awards • About • Apply

**After:**  
Admissions • Resources • Funding • Get Involved • Awards • About • Contact Us • Apply

### Bringing the Page to Life

The old homepage was flat and forgettable. We rebuilt it to inspire action and spark pride.

Highlight cards with key stats:  
- 130+ Graduate Programs  
- Carnegie R1 Research Institution  
- 3,000+ Students from 50 States & 60+ Countries  
- Utah’s Only Land-Grant & Space-Grant Institution

Visual storytelling:  
We replaced plain buttons with interactive image cards to help students envision themselves at USU.

Local pride:  
The marketing team shared that many students mentioned Utah’s stunning landscape as a deciding factor — so we leaned into that. Aerial campus views and scenic banners helped bring that emotion to the surface.

### The Result

While quantitative data was limited, stakeholder and user feedback indicated a strong positive reception.

- Students described the new site as “welcoming,” “fun,” and “full of Aggie pride”
- Marketing began using the site more actively at events
- Internal stakeholders appreciated the clearer content and reduced clutter

But the biggest win?  
We helped the Grad School shift focus to where it mattered most:  
Connecting with future students, not duplicating content for current ones.

### Visual Highlights for Portfolio Layout

Here are some quick visual snippets you could feature alongside the case study:

- Interviewed 50 students and ran 10 usability tests  
- Removed unused pages based on analytics and feedback  
- Redesigned navigation to match user tasks, not internal labels  
- Used scenic imagery to reflect what really inspires prospective students  
- Built in Modern Campus CMS under brand and accessibility constraints
